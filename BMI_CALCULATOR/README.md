Display BMI category: underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, or clinically obese.

Rounding of input values for a cleaner presentation.

### Usage
Run the program in your Python environment.

Choose the unit for height (either meters or feet) and weight (either kilograms or pounds).

Enter your height and weight in the chosen units.

The program will calculate your BMI, round it to one decimal place, and display the result along with your BMI category.
